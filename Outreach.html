<h1>Outreach</h1>
<p>All the teams focus on the robot, but we have decided outreach is just as important. Each team member past or new has gained so much from FIRST and we want to give it back.
</p>
<h3>Some examples of our outreach are </h3>
<h5><p>Physics in Action</p></h5>
<div id="otext">
<p>Date: May 17, 1 hour</p>
<p>reparation: Prepared the robot for demonstration and brought it and the center vortex into school.</p>
<p>Description: Brought the robot into 1st period, SMART Lunch, 3rd period, and 4th period to demonstrate the robot to students in Physics I and II. Julie and I demonstrated the robot, explained the engineering process, and let the kids drive the robot.</p>
</div>
<h5><p>Science Fair</p></h5>
<div id="otext">
<p>Date: April 19, 2 hours</p>
<p>Preparation: Prepared the robot for demonstration and brought the other demonstration pieces (scissor lift, motor we disassembled, etc.)</p>
<p>Description: Contacted the organizer for a local elementary school science fair and asked if we could bring in the robot to show the kids. They agreed and helped us set up in a room where kids and parents circulated around. The kids took turns driving the robot and looking at the other demonstration pieces we laid out on the table. Chloe and the coach talked to students and parents and explained the demonstrations, while Ethan and Mohit helped kids drive the robot.</p>
</div>
<h5><p>Children's Day Off</p></h5>
<div id="otext"><p>Date: April 27, 2 hours</p>
<p>Preparation: Prepared the robot for demonstration, practiced what I would say, and prepared the other demonstrations.</p>
<p>Description: Brought the robot into Bayer's Take Your Child to Work Day. Chloe, Ethan, and Mohit presented the robot in front of a large audience of about 100 kids. Chloe introduced the team and Ethan demonstrated the robot. The audience was then split up into two groups. One group looked at all the demonstration pieces presented by Chloe and the Coach, the other learned more about the robot specifics with Ethan and Mohit.</p>

<h5><p>Cub Scout Day Camp</p></h5>
<div id="otext"><p>Date: August 3rd</p>
<p>Preparation: Prepared the robot for demonstration.</p>
